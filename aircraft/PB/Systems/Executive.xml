  The channels below are simply a way to group components that have a common overall function.
  The first channel calculates certain elapsed times that can be used later. Not all of them
  are currently used, and some may not be. They could be used, for instance, if pitch guidance
  was given as a pitch angle as a function of elapsed time. It is common, for instance, for the
  uphill climb to orbit to be given as a simple open loop function where theta (pitch) angle is
  a function of some time - or rather a normalized t-prime, with the elapsed time divided by the
  total powered flight time being the controlling term. Such an algorithm (linear tangent pitch
  steering) is described in the document here: http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/643209.pdf.
  See page 12, (equation 20).
  
  Currently in this file, however, ascent guidance is simpler, with a simple pitch rate given as
  the target.
