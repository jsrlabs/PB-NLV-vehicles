* sim development plan
** TODO more useful output plots
** calculate losses
** annealing
** modify guidance to permit 90 deg pitch
** statistics and convergence plot on optimizer iterations
** optimization:
*** look at Brent's algorithm in Numerical Recipes for faster optimizer (re Ares I paper)
*** http://www.scipy-lectures.org/advanced/mathematical_optimization/index.html
*** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory_optimization
** faster compiler options, retry later
*** gcc -O6: 4.2 seconds
*** gcc -O2: 4.3
*** gcc -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -march=native: 4.3
*** gcc -Ofast -fomit-frame-pointer -march=native: 4.2
*** 1 sec faster with logging turned off
** test different dt's
** validate sim using Vanguard data
** publish Vanguard sim for PSAS
** look at natronics
** squawk: removing integrator settings in PBScript.xml causes change in apogee
** if needed, use CEA to make map of engine Isp vs O/F or other parameters
** ability to easily enter vehicle configuration
** DONE get faster desktop running
** DONE ability to run 2 or more vehicle configurations, compare results
** DONE modify trajectory.py to support alternate vehicle on the cmdline
** DONE use fuel fill level for pitch table index
** DONE capture tank pct-full at startup
** DONE cleanup PBScript, replace hokey simtime >= 150 check with arming.  try delay
* model development plan
** try prepending custom hardcoded DOCTYPE to xml (loaded from PB.xml or Propulstion.xml) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/991864/creating-a-doctype-with-lxmls-etree/2858690#2858690
** or try alternate xml parser https://stackoverflow.com/a/2155040
** or try xmlproc DTD api https://stackoverflow.com/a/2148315
** why is Paul's burnout thrust lower than the model's?
** read http://www.public.iastate.edu/~aero311l/blowdown.pdf
** read http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150015771.pdf
** check on oscillations at staging
oscillates around +/- alpha.  aerodynamically stable!?!
** check on pressurant gas mass for fills: 40% 50% 75%
** non-symmetric propellant depletion, will it cause excessive pitch/yaw during staging?
** what is max allowed alpha*q?
** DONE check on symmetry of fuel vs oxi blowdown pressure curves.  Paul says same pressure drops so mixture ratio won't change
** DONE gamma for fuel pressurant.  Paul says 1.4
** DONE check on flatness of Isp at low chamber pressure
yes, see CEA-runs/htp-kero.out
225 psi = 3080 m/s
99 psi = 3060 m/s
40 psi = 3040 m/s
